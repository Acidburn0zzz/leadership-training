## 1:1 meetings

#### Goals

There are three main goals of these mentorship meetings. You'll see these reflected in the structure and resources we provide.

1. **Connect as humans**: Use this one on one time to get to know the people you are mentoring and help connect them to others in the network. For many of them, this will be their first time at MozFest -- these meetings give them a chance to make a buddy before the big event.
  * Spend some time in each meeting getting to know them personally. Be genuine when asking how they're doing.
  * Introduce them to others who may have relevant interests or skills to their project.
2. **Help their project suceed**: We're helping participants engage and deepen contributorship on their projects and sessions.
  * Set goals around their project and help break them down to tasks to work on over the next 12 weeks.
  * Connect them to resources or skills they may need, if possible.
3. **Apply lessons from Working Open**: Help participants apply what they're learning in the *Open Leadership Training Series* to their specific projects.
  * Review their assignments and provide feedback when appropriate.
  * Encourage them to apply best practices from working open to their work.
