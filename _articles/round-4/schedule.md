### Two Cohorts

We have two separate cohorts going through Open Leadership Training this round: [Online Cohort](#online-cohort) and [WOW Cohort](#wow-cohort). The Online Cohort will go through the trainings during online cohort meetings. The WOW Cohort will go through the trainings at an in-person Working Open Workshop (WOW).


### Online Cohort

The online cohort schedule for Round 4 is coming soon! In the meantime, you can look at [the round 3 schedule](/leadership-training/round-3/schedule/).


### WOW Cohort
This Cohort is run in partnership with [Mozilla Science](http://science.mozilla.org/), featuring only Science projects. All the demo calls will be happening together with the Online Cohort.
