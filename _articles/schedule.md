### Two Cohorts

We have two separate cohorts going through Open Leadership Training this round: [Online Cohort](#online-cohort) and [WOW Cohort](#wow-cohort). The Online Cohort will go through the trainings during online cohort meetings. The WOW Cohort will go through the trainings at an in-person Working Open Workshop (WOW).

### Online Cohort

* **Meetings** (one meeting a week, 30 - 90min)
  * 1.5h x 5 - office hours run by Mozilla staff with the entire cohort. We’ll introduce the next module and go over any discussion questions from assignments.
  * 30min every 2 weeks - 1:1 mentorship meetings every two weeks with your mentor. Additional topic experts may join from time to time as needed.
  * 1h x 3 - demo calls where you'll share your progress with the Mozilla commmunity and ask for help
* **Homework**
  * 1-2h / week - complete that week’s assignment from the [OLTS](http://mzl.la/open-leadership)

Open Leadership Training requires you to add one meeting a week (from 30 to 90min) to your schedule and complete assignments around your open project.

#### Online Cohort Schedule
We'll be meeting online each week at two different times. Participants are welcome to join the time that works best for them. Times:

* Every Tuesday at 17:00 ET / 22:00 UTC ([check your timezone](http://arewemeetingyet.com/Toronto/2017-03-21/17:00/w/Open%20Leadership%20Training))
* Every Wednesday at 11:00 ET / 16:00 UTC ([check your timezone](http://arewemeetingyet.com/Toronto/2017-03-22/11:00/w/Open%20Leadership%20Training))
