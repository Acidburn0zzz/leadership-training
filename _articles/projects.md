I've taken up a new role as the volunteer community moderator for Mozilla Clubs Discourse[http://forum.learning.mozilla.org]. I would like to work on how we could encourage our larger community to work in the open.

We will develop a survey to explore the underlying reasons for failure to adopt open-science (OS) practices in academia. The survey will seek to:
1) Understand researchers’ knowledge of and engagement with OS practices; 2) Learn about obstacles that prevent them from engaging in OS practices; 3) Ask what would incentivize them to adopt OS practices.
First we will test the survey in our home institutions, but our goal is to distribute the survey to other academic institutions across the globe.
