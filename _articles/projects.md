### List of Participating Projects

#### AcademicGlassCeiling
*Kelly Clancy ([@kellybclancy](https://twitter.com/kellybclancy)) & Raquel Martins*

The female (cis/female-identifying/gender non-conforming) population is grossly underrepresented among the upper echelons of academia. This platform will be a space to share their experiences and build safer, more inclusive campuses for academics and students alike. We envision users will use this platform to share workplace reviews across categories ranging from compensation to parenting support to mentorship. We hope to help users to develop robust mentoring and support networks, and empower them with the information they need to break through the glass ceiling.
