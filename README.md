# Open Leadership Training, Winter 2017
#### March - June 2017
14 week online mentorship program on Working Open for Mozilla community members

Testing the [Open Leadership Training Series](http://mzl.la/open-leadership) + one on one mentorship


####This program is designed to connect open leaders and increase collaboration and contributorship on open projects in our network. This will serve as a generalized way to test a shared onboarding experience across our communities, increase collaboration among programs and strengthen bonds within our network.

## Who is this for?
Community members starting up or currently leading open projects within any Mozilla program (Science, Learning, Advocacy, IoT, Women & Web Literacy, Participation +more).

**Commitment**: ~3h / week


## What will you learn?
The [Open Leadership Training Series](http://mzl.la/open-leadership) (OLTS) is designed to teach you best practices in  “working open” -- a way of working in which
* a community of people collaborate to make or build something amazing,
* and any product or knowledge that the community of collaborators creates is shared widely and freely with the public on the world wide web.

The 1:1 mentorship will provide additional support as you apply what you’ve learned to your specific project community.

## Who are the mentors?
The mentors are Mozilla staff and community members who have completed Open Leadership training and mentorship in the past. They all have experience running open projects, facilitating events and building communities. They’ve demonstrated an understanding of working openly and collaboratively on projects.

## What will it looks like?
* **Meetings**
  * 1h / week - office hours run by Mozilla staff with the entire cohort. We’ll introduce the next module and go over any discussion questions from assignments.
  * 30min / 2 weeks - 1:1 mentorship meetings every two weeks with your mentor. Additional topic experts may join from time to time as needed.
* **Homework**
  * 1-2h / week - complete that week’s assignment from the OLTS
