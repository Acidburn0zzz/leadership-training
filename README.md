# Open Leadership Training, Spring 2017
#### March - June 2017
14 week online mentorship program on Working Open for Mozilla community members


####Are you building in the open? Join forces with Mozilla!

Open Leadership Training Round 3 starts in March 2017! We’re looking for Open Project Leaders who want to engage more contributors in their work, increase collaboration, and connect with other leaders in the Mozilla Leadership Network. Apply to be an Open Project Lead today!


## Who is this for?

Open Leadership Training is for anyone who is currently running or starting an open project and wants to invest in their open leadership skills. Project leads, partners, or small groups of co-leaders responsible for project success and growth.

The project doesn’t have to be technical! It can be curriculum (open educational resource), an open data project or report, an open source software project, or anything else that has:

1. a way for others to get involved
2. a feature, release, or MVP (minimum viable product) to work on publicly with community members for the duration of the program

**Commitment**: ~3h / week for 14 weeks + available during the Global Sprint 2017 (details TBA)


## What will you learn?
The [Open Leadership Training Series](http://mzl.la/open-leadership) (OLTS) is designed to teach you best practices in  “working open” -- a way of working in which
* everyone is invited to collaborate on something amazing,
* and any new product or knowledge is shared widely and freely.

The 1:1 mentorship will provide additional support as you apply what you’ve learned to your specific project community.

## Who are the mentors?
The mentors are Mozilla staff and community members who have completed Open Leadership Training in the past. They all have experience running open projects, facilitating events and building communities. They’ve demonstrated an understanding of working openly and collaboratively on projects.

## What will it look like?
* **Meetings** (one meeting a week, 30 - 90min)
  * 1.5h x 5 - office hours run by Mozilla staff with the entire cohort. We’ll introduce the next module and go over any discussion questions from assignments.
  * 30min every 2 weeks - 1:1 mentorship meetings every two weeks with your mentor. Additional topic experts may join from time to time as needed.
  * 1h x 3 - demo calls where you'll share your progress with the Mozilla commmunity and ask for help
* **Homework**
  * 1-2h / week - complete that week’s assignment from the OLTS
